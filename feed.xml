      <title>Laser Cutting</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are a few laser cutting options in the area. Here&amp;rsquo;s a rundown of each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BEB&lt;/strong&gt;: The RISD Architecture department has a laser cutter in the bottom floor of the BEB. Architecture students take priority so it might be difficult to get time on the machine without an ambassador in the department. Payment is based on time on the machine so more intricate designs will take much longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bud at Precision Laser&lt;/strong&gt;: Up in Pawtucket, Precision Laser is a one man shop run by Bud. He sounds cranky over the phone but is extremely helpful. It&amp;rsquo;s a good idea to give him several days lead time on your piece, and usually he&amp;rsquo;ll surprise you with a call letting you know it&amp;rsquo;s done early. Let him know that you&amp;rsquo;re a RISD student up front and he&amp;rsquo;ll ask you to pay what you can. Please don&amp;rsquo;t take advantage of this generosity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.precisionlaserri.com/&quot;&gt;Precision Laser&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AS220 Labs&lt;/strong&gt;: The Labs at AS220 also has a laser cutting facility along with vinyl cutting, 3D printing, and a CNC router. The facilities are available for use after &lt;a href=&quot;http://shop.as220.org/collections/workshops-as220-labs&quot;&gt;taking a two session course on each machine&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, you can &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.as220.org/labs/about/&quot;&gt;hire the monitors/shop managers to cut material for you&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Materials for cutting can be purchased at the RISD 3D store or online through &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inventables.com/&quot;&gt;Inventables&lt;/a&gt;. The RISD Materials Resource center on the 2nd floor of the Fleet Library has a comprehensive swatch book of the materials stocked by Inventables if you wish to see physical samples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please ask any store you purchase acrylic from if it&amp;rsquo;s safe to be used on a laser cutter and be sure to verify with the cutter that they&amp;rsquo;re comfortable cutting your material. Wood has a tendency to burn on the edges and some pieces of plexi won&amp;rsquo;t be able to be cut as they will emit toxic fumes.&lt;/p&gt;
