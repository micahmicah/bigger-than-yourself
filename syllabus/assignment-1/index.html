        <h1>Reproduction &amp; Form</h1>

<p>The first assignment will be an examination of the human scale. Next week, bring to class a full size reproduction of yourself.</p>

<p>Take into consideration this moment of translation. Will your body be printed on a single piece of substrate? Projected? Will we see the pixels? Will we see the seams? Will there be color?</p>

<p>In addition to the reproduction of yourself, generate a piece of graphic form with the same method, at the same scale.</p>

<p>In addition to creating these reproductions. Travel to the ICA in Boston to view <a href="http://www.icaboston.org/exhibitions/exhibit/ragnar-kjartansson_the-visitors/">The Visitors</a> by Ragnar Kjartansson. Document your experience and prepare for a discussion about the work. How it&rsquo;s presented, how it&rsquo;s framed.</p>
