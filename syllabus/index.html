      <h1>Bigger Than Yourself: Course Syllabus</h1>

<h2>Course objectives:</h2>

<p>This course aims to challenge students to explore issues of visual form and verbal message within the physical environment. It is a reaction against the graphic designer&rsquo;s focus towards shrinking viewports and hand-held objects. Throughout the semester we will discuss the differences between private and public reading experiences and the opportunities for graphic designers to work in ways that dramatically interrupt or enhance architectural space.</p>

<p>Assignments will be given in the form of prompts. These prompts will be framed as a set of constraints paired with a series of questions. It will be up to the student to address these prompts with messages, contents, or stories of their choosing. In order for students to be successful it will be critical they have a passionate stake and strong point of view in the messages and experiences they are crafting.</p>

<p>The prompt serves as a focusing mechanism, to channel our collective energies into a shared set of challenges and issues. It is through discussing these obstacles and solutions that we all as a group can grow in our understanding of what it means to make work in this way.</p>

<h2>Structure</h2>

<p>Class time will be a mixture of group critiques, individual consultations, group discussions, demonstrations, workshops, and dedicated working hours.</p>

<p>It is expected that work resolves itself into full size installations on campus. It is important for us to evaluate the work at proper scale and to truly experience the work as a resolved object. Tools of documentation, drawing, sketching, and prototype building will be discussed as methods to work towards a final installed piece of work.</p>

<h2>Crit Forms</h2>

<p>In order to install work on campus (and anywhere else, really) it is important to receive proper permissions from the facilities office in a written crit form. This will help ensure your work isn&rsquo;t disassembled or thrown out by the maintenance crew and that our campus isn&rsquo;t damaged. Please be respectful to our campus community and don&rsquo;t propose work that will damage or permanently alter structural elements of the campus in any way. This provides a unique set of challenges in the temporal
 nature of the work.</p>

<h2>Attendance</h2>

<p>In accordance with RISD&rsquo;s attendance policy, students are required to be present and active in every class session. If a student is absent for two sessions the instructor has the right to fail that student for falling too far behind in the coursework. </p>

<h2>Schedule</h2>

<p>Class runs from 1:10pm to 6:10pm on Friday afternoons in DC___.  </p>

<p>There will be two instances in which students will be expected to travel away from RISD&rsquo;s campus to do research. The first will be a visit to the ICA in Boston on each students&#39; own time. The second will be a group trip to Dia:Beacon in Beacon New York. This trip will take place early on a Saturday, the class will leave Providence early in the morning and will return late in the evening. It is expected that everyone will be in attendance.      </p>

<h2>Evaluation</h2>

<p>Students will be evaluated based on the following criteria.</p>

<h3>Participation</h3>

<p>The critique serves as the central point of dialogue about the work we are all making. It is crucial for students to become invested in their critiques, not only in the evaluation and discussion of their own work, but in the work of others. This conversation and dialogue is an incredible opportunity to learn from a unique group of people. Please, do not waste this opportunity. Speak up in discussions, ask questions of your fellow students, ask questions of yourselves, ask questions of your instructor.</p>

<h3>Search / Process</h3>

<p>This course is predicated on those involved to be self motivated in their work. This must result in a robust making process that demonstrates students are looking for different ways to make work, to evaluate their work, and to make the work again. A robust process begins wide and narrows as ideas begin to clarify themselves. It is not enough to be inspired. Chuck Close once said &ldquo;inspiration is for amateurs, the rest of us just get to work.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>Craft</h3>

<p>Craft and visual form in this class won&rsquo;t be evaluated in terms of cleanliness or austerity. Rather the discussion about craft will be revolve around the desire of the student to remain in control over the chosen production methods and for those production methods to align with the chosen method. Craft is what viewers notice and it is important for designers to take ownership of how the work is ultimately viewed and experienced.</p>

<h3>Attendance / Preparation</h3>

<p>As mentioned above. Students are required to show up to class, on time with work ready for presentation.</p>
